<h1>Random Movies I've Watched in the Last Few Years</h1>

<h2>My Top Three</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. Se7en</h3>
<p>I just love the way the suspense of the film mixes with the mystery up until the very end.</p>

<h3>2. Jagt</h3>
<p>A deep and moving Danish drama that made me think of how fragile human reputation can be.</p>

<h3>3. Yes Man</h3>
<p>A cute and funny rom-com with one of my all time favorite male actors and an interesting and rather strong philosophical idea.</p>
